# eliza weisman

## Who?

I'm a [programmer](/code) and occasional [artist](/portfolio), based in Oakland,
California. I'm interested in systems programming, networking, and programming languages.
I'm currently working on open source infrastructure for cloud-native applications at
[buoyant.io](https://buoyant.io).

## Projects

Some projects I'm working on include:

+ **tracing**: Application-level tracing for Rust
  ([crates.io][tracing-crates]|[github][tracing-gh])

  I'm the primary maintainer of `tracing`, a collection of libraries for adding
  structured, contextual, and async-aware diagnostic instrumentation to Rust programs.
  `tracing` is part of the [Tokio project][tokio].
