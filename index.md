I'm a junior studying Applied Computing with a focus in Software Engineering at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. I I love programming and making things, and I'm especially motivated by the desire to solve interesting problems and to learn new things.

My favourite programming languages are Scala, Rust, and Python, and I also have a lot of experience with Java and some with C and Lisp. I'm a big fan of the functional programming paradigm. My main interests are programming languages and their design and implementation, autonomous systems and AI, systems programming, and tools for software developers, although I'm always interested to learn more about just about any area of computer science.

My friend Max Clive and I founded [MeteorCode Labs](https://meteorcodelabs.com) to develop and publish indie games. We've currently released an open-source game engine, [Pathway](https://github.com/MeteorCode/Pathway), and we're working on some more fun stuff.

I'm currently looking for summer internships and part-time programming jobs, so if you're interested to hire someone with my skills, please don't hesitate to [contact me](hawk.weisman@gmail.com).

Open-Source Projects
--------------------

+ [Pathway](https://github.com/MeteorCode/Pathway): An open-source event-based game engine for the JVM. (Scala, Java)
+ [seax](https://hawkweisman.me/seax): A SECD VM for evaluating programs in functional languages, Scheme interpreter, and assorted other fun stuff (work in progress) (Rust)
+ [DeeBee](https://hawkweisman.me/deebee): A tiny relational database supporting a subset of SQL. For educational purposes only. (Scala)
+ [Decaf](decaf): An alleged compiler for a so-called programming language. (Scala)
+ [USL](https://github.com/hawkw/USL): The Useless Stack Language. A simple toy language with some interestingly weird semantics (think Lisp meets PostScript). (Scala)
+ [remote-collab](http://teamremote.github.io/remote-sublime/): A SublimeText 3 plugin for remote pair programming. (Python 3)


Other Neat Stuff
----------------

+ [L-Systems](http://hawkweisman.me/notebook/programming,computer/science,scala/2015/02/15/l-systems/) implementation in Scala and Processing
+ A [Python script](https://github.com/hawkw/breadplan) for calculating recipes for the bread from Chad Robertson's _Tartine Bread_
+ [Jekyll layouts](https://github.com/hawkw/bigyll) for Big presentations
+ My [dotfiles](https://github.com/hawkw/dotfiles)
