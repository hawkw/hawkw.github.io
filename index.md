# eliza weisman

## Who?

I'm a [programmer](/code) and occasional [artist](/portfolio), based in Oakland,
California. I'm interested in systems programming, networking, and programming languages.
I'm currently working on open source infrastructure for cloud-native applications at
[buoyant.io](https://buoyant.io).

## What?

The main projects I'm currently working on are:

+ **[tracing][tracing-gh]**: Application-level tracing for Rust
  ([crates.io][tracing-crates]|[github][tracing-gh])

  I'm the author and primary maintainer of [`tracing`][tracing-gh], a
  collection of libraries for adding structured, contextual, and
  async-aware diagnostic instrumentation to Rust programs. `tracing` and
  its ecosystem of crates allow collecting structured, machine-readable
  execution traces from user-defined instrumentation points in Rust
  programs. This data can be used to generate logs, distributed traces,
  metrics, and more.

  `tracing` is part of the [Tokio project][tokio].

+ **[tokio]**: Rust's async runtime
  ([website][tokio]|[crates.io][tokio-crates]|[github][tokio-gh])

  I'm a member of the core maintainer team for [Tokio][tokio], the pre-eminent
  asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. Tokio provides core
  primitives for asynchronous, event-driven applications, like async IO,
  timers, a task scheduler, and  synchronization primitives.

+ **[linkerd][linkerd.io]**: Service mesh for Kubernetes
  ([website][linkerd.io]|[github][linkerd-gh])

  I'm one of the core maintainers of Linkerd 2's [high performance
  proxy][proxy-gh]. Linkerd is a service mesh for Kubernetes: an infrastructure
  layer for distributed applications consisting of lightweight Layer 7 proxies
  that provide security, observability, and reliability for communication
  between services, and a control plane for managing them.

+ **[tokio-console][console-gh]**: A debugger for async Rust ([github][console-gh])

  I'm the primary maintainer of the the [Tokio Console project][console-gh]. The
  Tokio Console provides a suite of debugging tools for asynchronous Rust
  applications, built on top of [`tracing`][tracing-gh].

  `tokio-console` is part of the [Tokio project][tokio].

+ **[mycelium][myco-gh]**: A very silly operating system ([github][myco-gh])

  In my Copious Free Time, I'm working on writing a hobby operating system,
  called `mycelium`. It runs on x86_64, and executes user programs as
  WebAssembly modules...or at least, it *will*, some day. Right now it mostly
  just prints "hello world" and crashes a lot.
