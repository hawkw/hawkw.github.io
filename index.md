I'm a junior studying Software Engineering at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. I love programming, making things, and solving problems. 

My favourite programming languages are Scala and Python, and I also have a lot of experience with Java and C. I'm always interested in learning new languages, as well, such as Haskell, Go, and Lisps.

My friend Max Clive and I founded [MeteorCode Labs](https://meteorcodelabs.com) to develop and publish indie games. We've currently released an open-source game engine, [Pathway](https://github.com/MeteorCode/Pathway), and we're working on some more fun stuff.

Open-Source Projects
--------------------

+ [Pathway](https://github.com/MeteorCode/Pathway): An open-source event-based game engine for the JVM. (Scala, Java)
+ [DeeBee](https://github.com/hawkw/deebee): A tiny relational database supporting a subset of SQL. For educational purposes only. (Scala)
+ [Decaf](https://github.com/hawkw/decaf): An alleged compiler for a so-called programming language. (Scala)
+ [USL](https://github.com/hawkw/USL): The Useless Stack Language. A simple toy language with some interestingly weird semantics (think Lisp meets PostScript). (Scala)
+ [remote-collab](http://teamremote.github.io/remote-sublime/): A SublimeText 3 plugin for remote pair programming. (Python 3)
+ [breadplan](https://github.com/hawkw/breadplan): A Python script for calculating recipes for the bread from Chad Robertson's _Tartine Bread_. (Python 3)
