title:  "Making a Three Course Meal in a Hurry"
author: eliza

This is an extended metaphor.

Imagine you have to make a three-course meal. You're preparing a pasta dish,
something involving sauteéd vegetables, and a dessert of some kind — maybe a
pie. 

That's a lot of different things you need to cook, and they all take time. For
the sake of the metaphor, let's say each dish takes you thirty minutes to 
cook. I know they don't actually, but bear with me. 

Now here's the problem: you only have half an hour before you need to serve
dinner. What do you do?

One obvious solution comes to mind: you have three dishes to make, so you can
call up two friends. You assign a dish to each of your friends, and you take the
third. With the three of you working in _parallel_, all three dishes should be
ready in time.

(The didactic purpose of this metaphor is probably starting to show through, but
let's continue.)

Of course, this approach scales nicely. If you wanted to make a four- or even a
five-course meal, you can just call up additional friends...until you run out of
burners on your stove, or spend so much time _communicating_ about who gets to
use this knife or that mixing bowl next when 

Parallelism is a kind of concurrency.
