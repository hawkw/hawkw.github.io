I love solving tricky problems and making interesting things, and I'm always interested in finding work. If you are aware of any positions or opportunities for programmers or software engineers that I might be interested in, please don't hesitate to contact me by email at `hi(at)hawkweisman.me`.

As I am currently still a college student, I'm primarily interested in internships or opportunities for remote contract work, but this may change in the future.
